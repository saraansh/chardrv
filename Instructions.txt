ls -l
Lists all the contents in a folder

ls -l /dev | head
Lists all the files in RAM
Above command gives the device listing
If a device listing starts with c followed by 9 digits
then it refers to a character device with 9 digits representing the read-write access

After executing the above command the entries contain two numbers separated by comma
eg. 10, 235 -> where the first number is the major number and the second is the minor number

Linux associates /dev entry with the driver using the major number
Alternatively, the major number represents a unique way of identifying a driver associated with a particular device

Minor number corresponds to the number of instances of the device.


ls -l /dev | grep sda
Hard-drive Device listing
We notice that there is a single major number for all the entries which states
that there is a single block device driver (observe the letter 'b' at the start) responsible for all the partitions of the disk

>> Create a file simple_char_drv.c to contain the driver code [Already done]
>> Open /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build/include/linux/fs.h
>> Search for struct file_operations
>> Copy the necessary four lines from struct and edit it. [Already Done]
>> Create the Makefile. [Already Done]
>> Build the module via this command:
   make -C /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/build M=$PWD modules
>> To load the driver:
   sudo insmod ./chardrv_simple_char_drv.ko
   To check the driver is loaded or not:
   ls grep | char
>> To confirm our driver is loaded for major number 240:
   cat /proc/devices
>> Make a sudo character device:
   sudo mknod -m 666 /dev/simple_char_device c 240 0
>> The 666 field in the above code gives all users read-write access.
>> sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
   Invokes the chardrv_simple_module_init function
>> Open a new terminal and enter the following two commands:
   cat /dev/simple_char_device
